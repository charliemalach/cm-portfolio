Charlie's Portfolio

This is just my website portfolio I created both for experience and to catch the eye of potential employers. This portfolio utilizes multiple different skills including web design and web development. 
This project contains HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
This project was started July, 2021 and is still ongoing. 
This project is hosted entirely on GitHub.
